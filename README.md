Demonstration of different Machine Learning techniques for classification tasks using the US Census Adult Data Set as an example. 

The objective is to compare the Bayesian implementation of Logistic Regression and Bayes Discriminant Rule with alternative techniques.

The methods implemented are:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Bayesian Logistic Regression
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (Bayes Discriminant Rule)
4. Naive Bayes

Performance is mainly evaluated using balanced accuracy given the imbalanced nature of the data set.
